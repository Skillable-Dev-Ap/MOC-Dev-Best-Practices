### This file is being used as the creation for Documentation of *MOC CO Best pratices* when building / writting Labs. 

** Questions to Ponder ** :
- identify the 5-7 consistent errors that are patterns of how COs struggle with standardizing with each new course

1. Improper spacing of notes, alerts, and images within instruction steps
2. lack of use of back tiks when typing code blocks
3. Image Pathing 
4.
